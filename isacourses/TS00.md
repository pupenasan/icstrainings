CCST—Special Bonus!
Take this review course and schedule an electronic CCST exam on the date and at the location of your choosing—at no additional fee! That's a  $398 savings! If you plan to take the exam, your exam fee will be waived ONLY if you attend the review course AND you meet the CCST  qualifications. 

ISA has recently changed the requirements for the CCST program; now,  there is no application form. By taking the exam, you self-certify that  you:

- Are fully compliant with the [CCST certification criteria, qualifications and conditions](https://www.isa.org/certification/ccst/ccst-requirements) for which you are applying; and
- Acknowledge that you may be subject to a random ISA CCST  verification audit and will fully agree to provide the supporting  documents proving your qualifications.
